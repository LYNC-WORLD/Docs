# ðŸ“‡ Indexer
<span className="text-lg text-[rgb(192,192,192)]">There are main no-code components to indexing with the Movement on-chain data.</span>

Most applications require an indexer to efficiently query for on-chain state as the Movement Node API provides only a basic, stable API and does not support data shaping required for rich user experiences. The LYNC Indexer on Movement processes raw blockchain data for app-specific needs, enabling low-latency and enhanced experiences for end-user applications.

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can query for the Current Coin Balances of an account. More usage examples can be found in example queries.
