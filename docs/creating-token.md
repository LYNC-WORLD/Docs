# Create a Token

The Create Token page on [Pump Solana](https://solana-launchpad-opal.vercel.app/) simplifies the process of deploying custom meme tokens on the Solana blockchain, with full control over supply, identity, and tokenomics. It provides a simple and easy interface for creating new meme tokens without requiring blockchain development knowledge. Just by adding a few details like token name, token symbol, and token image, you can create and launch your meme tokens on the Solana blockchain.
Before creating a meme token, you need to connect to the [Pump Solana](https://solana-launchpad-opal.vercel.app/) application using your wallet. Once connected, you can navigate to the page where you can launch a new meme token on the Solana blockchain.

## Steps to create a token

### Enter token details

- Token name - Specify a name for your token (e.g., "RocketDoge"). This name represents your token and will be visible to users.
- Token Symbol - Provide a short and unique symbol for your token (e.g., "RDOGE"). This is typically an abbreviation or a creative identifier.
- Token Image - Provide an eye-catching image for your token. This image will be a digital identifier for your token and can help create an engaging community involvement.
- Token description - Provide a small description of your meme token. This may include the inspiration behind creating the meme token and some other information that will help users understand the token better.
- Token social links (Optional) - Users can also provide social media links for the token, like Twitter, Telegram, and the token's official website. It can help in creating great community engagement and social media branding for the token.

### Choose the amount of tokens to buy

In the next step, you can choose the amount of the token you want to buy for yourself. This step is completely optional, and you can skip this step. However, it is recommended to buy some amount of tokens while creating them, as it can help protect the token from snipers.
You can also choose between the Solana value or the token amount when buying some amount of the token for yourself. If you choose to use the Solana value, you will get tokens worth the entered Solana amount. If you choose to use a token amount, then you will have to pay the Solana value cost for the entered amount of the token.

<br></br>

### Review the token details and confirm the transaction

In the next steps, you can click on the "CONFIRM" or "SKIP THIS" button depending on whether you want to buy some amount of the tokens for yourself or not. This will initiate a transaction on the Solana blockchain. A pop-up will appear asking you to confirm the transaction. Once you confirm the transaction using your connected wallet, your token will be created on the Solana blockchain and will get listed on the Pump Solana application so that users can trade it.

<br></br>

> NOTE -
>
> Ensure you have enough funds in your wallet to cover the transactionâ€™s gas fees and also the amount you entered (if any) in the option step.

After completing all the above steps, your token will be deployed on the Solana blockchain and is ready to be traded on Pump Solana. You can share the deployment of your meme token on social media like Twitter to let the community know about your token and create an engagement around your token.

> NOTE -
>
> Every token created on Pump Solana has a fixed total supply of 1 billion. Out of which a maximum of 800 million is available on the platform for trading, and the other 200 million is locked. However, if you have chosen to lock the initial supply of the token while creating the token, only the initially locked amount of the token will be available for trading out of a maximum of 800 million tokens, unless the complete token supply is unlocked by you.
