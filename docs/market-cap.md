# Market Cap

Market capitalization, or "market cap," represents the total dollar($) market value of a token while it's being traded on Mew.gg.

As more and more tokens are bought, the price of the token goes up, and the market cap increases.

> NOTE -

> Mew.gg only shows the market cap of a particular token until the token is bonded.

## Market cap calculation on Mew.gg

Formula -

marketCap=1,000,000,000âˆ—tokenPriceInUSD

Since the total supply of the token is 1 billion, to calculate the market cap we multiply it by the current token price in USD.
