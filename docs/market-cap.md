# Market Cap

Market capitalization, or "market cap," represents the total dollar($) market value of a token while it's being traded on [Uponly](https://launchpad-git-base-launchpad-lync-world.vercel.app/).

<div className="flex flex-col items-center">
    <img src="/img/base/mrkt-cap.png"/>
    <span className="font-bold text-[rgb(192,192,192)]">Market cap is displayed on the top of a token's page</span>
</div>
<br></br>

As more and more tokens are bought, the price of the token goes up, and the market cap increases.

> NOTE -
>
> Uponly only shows the market cap of a particular token until the token is bonded.

  MarketCap = 1,000,000,000 Ã— TokenPriceInUSD

Since the total supply of the token is 1 billion, to calculate the market cap we multiply it by the current token price in USD.
