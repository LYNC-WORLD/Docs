# Not OG and CTO Tokens

## Not OG tokens

Not OG tokens on Mew.gg are meme tokens that resemble similar other popular tokens from the past on Mew.gg, either in name, symbol, token image, or overall concept. These tokens might mimic popular tokens to capitalize on their success, creating confusion among users. Not OG tokens are not the original creations and may lack the unique attributes or community backing of the original token they mimic.

## Identifying not OG tokens

These tokens may mislead users into thinking they are interacting with the original tokens. These tokens may temporarily attract attention, but they generally lack the sustainability of original tokens. Users should be cautious before interacting with Not OG tokens to ensure they align with their expectations and values.

Mew.gg tries to maintain transparency and integrity within its platform by clearly distinguishing original tokens from Not OG tokens. While the Not OG tokens may exist in the ecosystem, users can clearly distinguish between an original token and a Not OG token.

## CTO tokens

CTO tokens are meme tokens on Mew.gg that have been 100% dumped by their original creator through their holdings. When this occurs, the control of the token is taken over by the Mew.gg community. These tokens are labeled with a CTO (Community Take Over) tag, signifying that the original creator no longer holds any stake in the token.

Once a token is labeled as CTO, it will remain as a CTO token even if the creator of the token start trading the token again. This is necessary for the users to know that this token has once been dumped 100% by its creator.

Tokens with the CTO label allow users to identify that it has previously been dumped entirely by their creator. The CTO label ensures users are informed about the tokenâ€™s history, promoting accountability and trust within the Mew.gg ecosystem. Users should be cautious before interacting with CTO tokens, as they carry inherent risks from their abandonment history.
