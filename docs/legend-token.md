# Legend Token

Legend Token is a special recognition given to tokens that demonstrate exceptional performance (trade volume) on the Mew.gg platform. A meme token listed on Mew.gg is recognized as a "Legend Token" when the token crosses 60% of the bonding curve and sustains this performance for a good period, typically 1 to 2 hours. The bonding curve represents the token's growth percentage (starting from 0 through 100%), depending on the trade volume, demand, and market activity.

Meme tokens achieving the criteria for a legend are recognized as a "Legend Token" and prominently displayed on the Mew.gg homepage with a crown icon, showing their high demand and market activity on Mew.gg.

Legend Tokens are featured on the homepage, attracting attention from the Mew.gg community. Users can track the bonding curve performance of their tokens via the Mew.gg. Achieving Legend status shows strong market demand and community interest, potentially making the token grow further and great community engagement.
