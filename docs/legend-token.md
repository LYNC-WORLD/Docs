# Legend Token

Legend Token is a special recognition given to tokens that demonstrate exceptional performance (trade volume) on the [Pump Solana](https://solana-launchpad-opal.vercel.app/) platform. A meme token listed on [Pump Solana](https://solana-launchpad-opal.vercel.app/) is recognized as a "Legend Token" when the token crosses 60% of the [Bonding Curve](/bonding-curve.md)
and sustains this performance for a good period, typically 1 to 2 hours. The [Bonding Curve](/bonding-curve.md) represents the token's growth percentage (starting from 0 through 100%), depending on the trade volume, demand, and market activity.

Meme tokens achieving the criteria for a legend are recognized as a "Legend Token" and prominently displayed on the [Pump Solana](https://solana-launchpad-opal.vercel.app/) homepage with a crown icon, showing their high demand and market activity on [Pump Solana](https://solana-launchpad-opal.vercel.app/).
