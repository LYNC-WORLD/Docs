### Key features of Telegram mini apps:
* **Built with Web Technologies**: Mini apps are created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making them accessible across platforms.
* **Inline Integration**: Users can interact with mini apps directly in conversations, channels, or groups. For example, they might perform actions like voting in a poll or playing a game.
* **Bot-Powered**: Mini apps are often accompanied by Telegram bots, which handle the interaction logic. Bots can trigger the mini app and interact with the user through the chat interface.
* **Secure and Lightweight**: These apps are sandboxed within Telegram and cannot access users' private data unless explicitly allowed by the user.
* **Instant Launch**: Users can open mini apps with a single tap, and the apps load instantly, leveraging the Telegram WebView technology.
* **Cross-Platform**: Since they are web-based, they work across all devices where Telegram is supportedâ€”mobile, desktop, and web versions.
