## Introduction 

NFT Fetcher is a tool that allows developers to easily integrate NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) into game engines like Unity and Unreal. With just a few clicks, developers can fetch NFT from specific chains and contracts and integrate them into their game.

NFT Fetcher can be integrated into Unity and Unreal game engines with ease. Simply download the SDK from the NFT Fetcher website and import it into the engine by dragging and dropping the files.

## Fetching NFT 
NFT Fetcher allows developers to fetch NFT from specific chains and contracts. To do this, developers must choose the chain and contract address they want to fetch NFT from. Developers can also enter the contract address to fetch all NFTs from a specific contract or get NFTs from a wallet of a contract address.
