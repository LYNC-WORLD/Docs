# Create a new Wallet

```bash
POST https://server-aptos-sdk.lync.world/api/generate_wallet/create_wallet
```

This endpoint generates a new wallet for the user. Upon creation, a new wallet address and private key are generated. This endpoint requires the email of the user and network on which the account needs to be created for wallet creation and x-api-key and Lync's API key for request validation and it will return a newly created wallet's details, including the wallet address and private key. It's recommended to securely store the private key since it is required to access and manage the wallet.
