# Claiming the Rewards

Before claiming rewards, the user must have completed the lootbox opening process. The rewards have been displayed on the screen, showing which DAs and the amount of APTs the user has received.

After opening the lootbox, the user should review the rewards that were revealed. This ensures that the user understands what they are about to claim.

    <span className="font-bold text-[rgb(192,192,192)]">Users can view the rewards they get after opening the lootbox</span>
</div>
<br/>

The user will see the details of each NFT and the amount of APTs (fungible assets) they have received. To proceed with claiming the rewards, the user needs to click the **"Claim Your Rewards"** button. This action initiates the final step of the process.

Clicking the **"Claim Your Rewards"** button will take the action to complete the transfer of the rewards from the lootbox to the user’s Petra Wallet. The action will update the lootbox status to reflect that the rewards have been claimed, and the lootbox can no longer be used or reopened.

<div className="flex flex-col items-center">
    <img className="w-[80%]" src="/img/APTOS/lootbox/claim/claim-1.png"/>

</div>
<br/>

The Aptos Lootbox backend system performs the necessary operations to ensure the NFTs and APTs are correctly moved from the lootbox to the user’s wallet. After processing, the rewards are deposited into the user’s Petra Wallet. The user can immediately view the claimed NFTs and APTs in their Petra Wallet.

There is no need for the user to perform any additional actions to see the rewards in their wallet. The lootbox's status is updated to reflect that it has been used, and no further actions can be taken with that lootbox.

> Important Notes -
>
> - Each lootbox can only be claimed once. After the rewards are claimed, the user cannot claim additional rewards from the same lootbox.
> - Once rewards are claimed and transferred to the wallet, the action cannot be reversed. Users should ensure they want to claim the rewards before finalizing the action.
> - The rewards are accessible in the user’s wallet immediately after claiming, providing instant satisfaction and seamless integration with the user’s Petra Wallet.
