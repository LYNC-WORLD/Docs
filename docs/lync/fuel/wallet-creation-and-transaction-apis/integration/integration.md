# Integration

In this Section, you will learn about the integration of the APIs provided by LYNC for creating an on-chain wallet on Fuel and performing blockchain transactions on the Fuel blockchain network.

Our wallet creation and transaction APIs provide a simple yet powerful way to interact with blockchain by providing simple API endpoints that you can integrate into your application and get access to blockchain interactions without worrying about the other complexities of blockchain.

This section explores the following functionalities that LYNC provides through its APIs for users:

1. [API Overview](./overview.md)
2. [Create a new wallet](./create-new-wallet.mdx)
