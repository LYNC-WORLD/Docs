# Opening a Lootbox

Once a lootbox is created, users (or others) can open the lootbox by pressing the 'Open' button, revealing the randomized rewards.

To open a lootbox, the user must be connected to the Fuel Lootbox platform using their Fuel Wallet. This ensures that the rewards from the lootbox will be deposited directly into their wallet after opening.

These lootboxes may include lootboxes they created themselves or the lootboxes shared with them by others.

</div>
<br/>

## Initiate the Opening

After finding the lootbox, the user will see an “Open Lootbox” button on the open lootbox page. Upon clicking this button, the lootbox opening process is initiated, triggering the randomization of rewards inside the box.

To enhance the user experience and add a fun, visual element to the process, Fuel Lootbox incorporates an animated sequence when opening the lootbox. This adds excitement and suspense. The lootbox will display an animation, giving the user the feeling of actually “unlocking” something.

</div>
<br/>

## Random Reward Selection

While the animation is playing, the Fuel Lootbox system is in the background selecting the rewards based on the user-defined parameters that were set during lootbox creation.

If the lootbox contains NFTs, the system will randomly select some NFTs (within the range defined during lootbox creation) and choose which specific NFTs from the deposited pool will be given as a reward.

Similarly, for FTs (fungible tokens), the system will select a random number of tokens from the specified range and choose how many tokens will be given to the user.

The selection process is entirely random, ensuring each opening is unique and unpredictable.

If the user receives NFTs, they will see the details of which specific NFTs have been awarded to them. Similarly, if the lootbox includes FTs (fungible tokens), the user will see how many tokens they’ve received and the type of token.

After the rewards are revealed, the user must claim them to finalize the process and transfer the assets into their wallet. A “Claim” button will appear on the web page to claim the randomly selected rewards. Clicking this button initiates the final step of transferring the NFTs and FTs (fungible tokens) to the user’s Fuel Wallet.

    <span className="font-bold text-[rgb(192,192,192)]">Users can Claim the Randomly Selected Rewards After Opening the Lootbox</span>
</div>
<br/>

Once the user clicks the claim button, the rewards are automatically deposited into their connected Fuel Wallet. The NFTs and FTs are directly transferred into the user’s wallet. The user can now view their claimed assets in their Fuel Wallet immediately.

> Important Notes -
>
> - Each lootbox can be opened and claimed multiple per wallet address until the lootbox is empty. Users can open the lootbox and claim rewards as many times as they want until the lootbox becomes empty.
>
> - Once the lootbox is opened and the random rewards are determined, there is no option to change or modify the outcome. This randomness adds excitement and unpredictability to each opening.
>
> - Even if a user opens a lootbox but decides not to claim the rewards, they cannot reopen the box to try again.
