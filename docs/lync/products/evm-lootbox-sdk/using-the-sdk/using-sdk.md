# Using the SDK

In this Section, you will learn the functions provided by the SDK to integrate loot boxes, manage loot boxes, and interact with them in your project.

Our loot box SDK provides a variety of functionalities to create and manage the loot boxes including:

1. [Creating a new loot box](./create-new.md)
2. [Opening an already-created loot box](./open.md)
3. [Claiming rewards after opening a loot box](./claim.md)
4. [Whitelisting users to allow limited access to loot box opening and rewards claiming](./whitelist.md)
5. [Lootbox admin function](./admin.md)
6. [Useful information functions from LyncLootBox class](./useful-information.md)
7. [Multicall : opening and claiming multiple lootboxes in a single transaction](./multicall.md)

In the upcoming sections, we will learn about all the above functionalities individually.
