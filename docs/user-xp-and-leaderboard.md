# User XP and Leaderboard

## User XP

Mew.gg features a dynamic User XP (Experience Points) system to enhance user engagement and reward active participation in the Saga-based meme token ecosystem. This system calculates a user's XP based on the total value in USD($) of all meme tokens they hold on the platform. The higher the value of tokens you hold, the higher your XP will be.

    <span className="font-bold text-[rgb(192,192,192)]">The user's XP (Experience points)</span>
</div>
<br></br>

The XP is automatically calculated based on real-time token holdings and their market value in USD, giving every user a live score that evolves as their portfolio changes. Importantly, buying more tokens increases your XP, while selling tokens reduces it.

The maximum possible XP is 4100. You can increase your XP by buying more and more tokens on Mew.gg. This feature ensures that even the top holders must actively participate in the marketplace through trading, holding, or supporting community activity to fully maximize their XP potential.

</div>
<br></br>

## Leaderboard

The Leaderboard is a core feature of the Mew.gg platform that ranks users based on their XP scores. It reflects real-time activity and encourages users to actively participate in the meme token ecosystem on the Saga blockchain to rise through the ranks.

<div className="flex flex-col items-center">
    <img src="/img/home-leaderboard.png"/>
    <span className="font-bold text-[rgb(192,192,192)]">The leaderboard</span>
</div>
<br></br>

The leaderboard is a live, ranked list of users ordered by their current XP scores. It provides a transparent view of user activity and token engagement on the platform. For each entry on the leaderboard, the following information is displayed:

- Rank of the user
- The user name and wallet address of the user
- Current XP score of the user

    <span className="font-bold text-[rgb(192,192,192)]">A typical bonding curve of a token on Mew.gg</span>
</div>
<br></br>

The leaderboard updates regularly to reflect real-time XP changes based on token holdings. When users buy more meme tokens, their XP increases, and they can climb the leaderboard. When they sell or transfer tokens, their XP decreases, which may lower their rank.
