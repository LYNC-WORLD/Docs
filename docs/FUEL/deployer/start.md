>Ensure your wallet is funded with sufficient tokens required for gas fees during the deployment process.

## Choose NFT Type for Deployment
Once your wallet is connected, you can choose the type of NFT you want to deploy:

* Nonfungible NFT (1/1 NFTs)
* Semi-fungible NFT (Multiple Editions)
* NFT Collections

After selecting the type of NFT you want to deploy, you will be guided through easy steps to customize and mint your digital asset.

Upon successful deployment, your NFT or NFT collection will be live on the Fuel blockchain. You will be able to manage, track, and interact with them directly from your connected wallet.
