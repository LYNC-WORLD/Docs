# Troubleshooting and FAQs

## What is the difference between deploying Multiple Edition (or 1/1 NFTs) and Collection?
Deploying a **single edition (1/1 NFT)** creates a unique, one-of-a-kind token with no duplicates, making it ideal for exclusive assets. **Multiple Edition NFTs** involve creating several identical copies of the same token, which allows for a limited run of the same design.

Deploying a **Collection** involves creating a group of NFTs, which can include either single-edition or multiple-edition tokens, and allows for the organization and management of various related NFTs under one contract.

## What if I cannot connect my wallet?
Ensure your wallet supports the Fuel network by checking its settings and permissions. You might need to enable specific dApps or network configurations. Also, make sure you're using the latest wallet version.

## Collections give me an option to select either a Multiple or 1/1 NFT. However, I couldn't find an option to add multiple of these in the same collection.
In Fuel NFT Deployer, collections are designed to categorize NFTs based on their type - **"1/1" (single-edition) or "Multiple" (multiple editions)**. This design is required for managing your NFTs within a single collection to maintain clarity and organization. Each collection is dedicated to one type to ensure ease of management and consistency in your NFT offerings.

## What to do if the wallet currently does not detect which network am I on - if it's the local node or the Testnet - at the moment.
Ensure that your wallet is configured correctly for network detection. Check if you have manually selected the appropriate network in your wallet settings. If the issue persists, verify that your local node or testnet setup is properly connected and accessible.

## How do I handle failed transactions?
Transaction failures may happen during high network traffic or if your wallet has insufficient funds. Try waiting for a less busy time, and ensure you have sufficient balance in your wallet for deployment and gas fees. Review any error messages for clues on resolving the issue.

## Is there a fee for deploying NFTs?
Deploying NFTs on the Fuel blockchain requires a gas fee. Ensure you have sufficient funds to cover the deployment cost, which can vary based on contract complexity and network conditions.

## How can I check the status of my deployed NFTs?
Use [Fuel's blockchain explorer](https://next-app.fuel.network/) or your wallet's transaction history to check the status of your NFT deployment. You can also view and manage your NFTs through the dashboard in Fuel NFT Deployer for detailed token information and status.

## What should I do if I forget my wallet password or recovery phrase?
Follow the wallet's password recovery instructions and securely store your recovery phrase. Without the recovery phrase, wallet or fund recovery might be impossible.

## How do I verify the success of my NFT deployment?
Check your deployment transaction status using Fuel's blockchain explorer by entering the transaction ID. Verify if it was confirmed and included in the blockchain. Once deployed, review the confirmation message or receipt in Fuel NFT Deployer to ensure the successful creation of your NFT collection.

## What if my NFT appears to be missing or does not show up in my wallet?
There might be a delay in syncing your NFT; try refreshing your wallet or waiting a few minutes. Ensure your wallet is on the correct blockchain network.

## What if I encounter performance issues with the NFT platform?
Check the Fuel NFT Deployer platform or blockchain network for any issues or maintenance affecting performance. Ensure your browser is up to date and your device has sufficient resources for smooth operation.
