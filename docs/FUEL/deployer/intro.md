# Introduction

## What is the NFT Deployer?

The **Fuel NFT Deployer** is a web application that enables anyone to create and deploy Nonfungible Tokens (NFTs), Semi-fungible Tokens (SFTs), and NFT Collections on the Fuel blockchain network even without knowledge of blockchain or coding skills. By connecting their wallets and following simple instructions, users can mint and manage NFTs or collections effortlessly.

## Why is the NFT Deployer Required?
The **Fuel NFT Deployer** eliminates the requirement of blockchain knowledge and other complexity by providing a straightforward platform where anyone can deploy NFTs or NFT collections without the need for technical knowledge. It is required because it:

* Makes NFT deployment accessible to all, from individual artists and content creators to businesses and brands.
* Streamlines the process, reducing time and effort compared to traditional methods.
* Minimizes the costs associated with hiring developers or acquiring specialized blockchain skills.
* Empowers users by giving them full control over their assets and creations without relying on intermediaries.

## What are Non-fungible, Semi-fungible Tokens, and Collections?
1. **Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs):** Unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a specific item or piece of content on the blockchain. Each NFT is distinct, meaning no two NFTs are alike, making them ideal for representing digital art, collectibles, music, videos, and more.
2. **Semi-fungible Tokens (SFTs):** These tokens are identical and can be exchanged for one another (like a currency). SFTs are useful for cases like event tickets, gaming assets, or vouchers, where multiple identical items are created, but their state changes after use.
3. **NFT Collections:** A set of NFTs grouped under a common theme or project. Collections can consist of either non-fungible or semi-fungible tokens. For example, an artist could create a collection of digital artworks, or a game developer could create a collection of in-game assets. Collections help organize NFTs and add value through curated offerings.
