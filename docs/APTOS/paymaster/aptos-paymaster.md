### Missing LYNC between Dapps and Users

In the rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology, user onboarding and transaction experiences remain significant hurdles for widespread adoption. Decentralized Applications (DApps) often present complexities that can deter potential users, particularly those unfamiliar with blockchain mechanics. 

### Key challenges include:


1. **Mandatory Wallet Balance for Gas Fees**: Users need APT tokens to cover gas fees, which requires buying tokens, completing KYC procedures, and transferring from exchanges to wallets. This multi-step process can be cumbersome and discouraging, especially for those new to Web3.

2. **Protracted Onboarding Process**: New users encounter a lengthy process involving KYC, buying crypto, setting up wallets, and connecting to DApps. This process can take days, causing potential users to abandon the application before they even start.

3. **Technical Proficiency Requirements**: Engaging with blockchain applications often requires understanding complex technical details, such as using wallets like Pontem and Petra, signing transactions, and managing gas fees, which can be challenging for users.

4. **Volatile and High Gas Fees**: The fluctuating nature of gas fees can significantly impact the user experience. High fees during network congestion can deter users from engaging with DApps, while the unpredictability adds to the overall frustration.
