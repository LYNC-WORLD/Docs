# LYNC Aptos Lootbox
**Loot boxes** are virtual mystery boxes in games that contain randomized in-game items. Loot boxes play a crucial role in keeping players engaged by creating a sense of anticipation and excitement around what they might receive. This encourages players to keep playing while generating significant revenue for game developers through in-game purchases.

## On Chain Lootboxes

**On-chain loot boxes** are a new, blockchain-based version of these virtual mystery boxes. These loot boxes use blockchain technology and smart contracts to manage every step of the process in a decentralized and transparent way. The use of blockchain ensures that no one can tamper with or manipulate the outcome, providing players with a fair and trustworthy experience

## Randomization and Its Importance
**Randomization** is the process that ensures each reward within a loot box is distributed in an unpredictable and unbiased way. It's a key component in creating and managing loot boxes because it directly impacts the player experience and the fairness of the system. The excitement of opening a loot box comes from the uncertainty of what it might contain, which is made possible by effective randomization. Randomization is crucial for creating and managing loot boxes because:

* The unpredictable nature of rewards makes opening loot boxes exciting and engaging for players.
* Proper randomization means every player has an equal chance of winning any given reward, preventing favoritism or manipulation.
* When players know that the randomization is genuinely fair and transparent, they are more likely to engage with the game and its loot boxes.

## LYNC's Aptos Lootbox
Introducing our new lootbox on the Aptos blockchain, designed to easily create, open lootboxes, and claim rewards, such as NFTs and tokens, directly within the web application interface. Our web application provides a simple yet powerful solution for creating and using an on-chain lootbox, claiming rewards in the form of NFTs and tokens on the Aptos blockchain network, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free user experience. With just a few clicks, users can unlock the full potential of randomness and blockchain transactions, enabling users to easily interact with the lootboxes within the web application's interface.

## What is inside a Lootbox
Our on-chain loot boxes are filled with a mix of **Digital Assets (DAs - a modern Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard for Aptos) and Fungible Assets (FAs - a modern replacement for the coin module that allows for seamless minting, transfer, and customization of fungible assets),** making every opening a unique and exciting experience. The contents of these boxes are chosen using a randomization method known as the **Verifiable Random Function (VRF)**, which is an on-chain mechanism that ensures complete fairness and transparency in selecting rewards.

**Digital Assets (DAs)** represent a modern Non-Fungible Token (NFT) standard for Aptos, a digital reward that players can receive when they open a loot box. Because DAs are non-fungible, each one has its distinct value and properties, making them highly desirable to players who want something unique and collectible.

**Fungible Assetss (FAs)** are a modern replacement for the coin module on the Aptos blockchain that allows for seamless minting, transfer, and customization of fungible assets for any use case. Players can earn these tokens through loot boxes and use them for in-game purchases, to unlock new levels, or trade them with other players.

By including these different types of DAs and FAs, our loot boxes provide a richer and more dynamic experience. The use of the **VRF (Verifiable Random Function)** ensures that every time a loot box is opened, the reward selection process is genuinely random and unbiased, enhancing trust and fairness in the reward system.
