# Understanding the Trade Chart

The trade chart on Pump Solana uses an **OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close)** graph to visually represent the price movements of meme tokens over time. It provides a clear and structured way to analyze the tokenâ€™s performance in intervals.

## Axes explanation

- X-Axis: Displays time, divided into **15-minute intervals**.
- Y-Axis: Represents the **price of the meme token in ETH**.

## Understanding OHLC components

For every 15-minute interval, the chart shows the following details:

- **O (Open):** The price at the beginning of the interval.
- **C (Close):** The price at the end of the interval.
- **H (High):** The highest price reached during the interval.
- **L (Low):** The lowest price reached during the interval.

## Interpreting the colors on the chart

- **Pink Bars:** Indicate that the price **increased** during the interval (Close > Open).
- **Red Bars:** Indicate that the price **decreased** during the interval (Close < Open).

## Price movement insights

- **Token Buy:** An increase in buying activity pushes the graph upwards.
- **Token Sale:** An increase in selling activity causes the graph to decline.
